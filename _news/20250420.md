We released [SeekWorld](https://github.com/TheEighthDay/SeekWorld), an open-source project exploring o3-like visual clue-tracking reasoning for geolocation. We open-sourced the SeekWorld [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheEighthDay/SeekWorld) and an RL-trained model, [SeekWorld-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheEighthDay/SeekWorld_RL_PLUS)! 🌍 [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/TheEighthDay/SeekWorld)](https://github.com/TheEighthDay/SeekWorld)
