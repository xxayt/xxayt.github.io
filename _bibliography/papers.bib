    abstract={For text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), which aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by ad-hoc textual queries, CLIP-based methods currently lead the way. Compared to CLIP4Clip which is efficient and compact, state-of-the-art models tend to compute video-text similarity through fine-grained cross-modal feature interaction and matching, putting their scalability for large-scale T2VR applications into doubt. We propose TeachCLIP, enabling a CLIP4Clip based student network to learn from more advanced yet computationally intensive models. In order to create a learning channel to convey fine-grained cross-modal knowledge from a heavy model to the student, we add to CLIP4Clip a simple Attentional frame-Feature Aggregation (AFA) block, which by design adds no extra storage / computation overhead at the retrieval stage. Frame-text relevance scores calculated by the teacher network are used as soft labels to supervise the attentive weights produced by AFA. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets justify the viability of the proposed method. TeachCLIP has the same efficiency and compactness as CLIP4Clip, yet has near-SOTA effectiveness.},

    abstract={Adding proper background music helps complete a short video to be shared. Previous research tackles the task by video-to-music retrieval (V2MR), which aims to find the most suitable music track from a collection to match the content of a given query video. In practice, however, music tracks are typically much longer than the query video, necessitating (manual) trimming of the retrieved music to a shorter segment that matches the video duration. In order to bridge the gap between the practical need for music moment localization and V2MR, we propose a new task termed Music Grounding by Short Video (MGSV). To tackle the new task, we introduce a new benchmark, MGSV-EC, which comprises a diverse set of 53K short videos associated with 35k different music moments from 4k unique music tracks. Furthermore, we develop a new baseline method, MaDe, which performs both video-to-music matching and music moment detection within a unifed end-to-end deep network.  Extensive experiments on MGSV-EC not only highlight the challenging nature of MGSV but also sets MaDe as a strong baseline.},
