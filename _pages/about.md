I am an incoming PhD student at the [AI & Media Computing Lab](https://ruc-aimc-lab.github.io/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xirong Li](http://lixirong.net/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree with honors in the Top-notch Program (a class of 15 elite students selected from 400+) from [College of Computer Science](http://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Qijun Zhao](http://www.scubrl.org/qjzhao).

My research primarily revolves around cross-media retrieval, open-set recognition, and computer vision, complemented by a broad curiosity in generative model and LLM.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
