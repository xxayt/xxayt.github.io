I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [AI & Media Computing Lab](https://ruc-aimc-lab.github.io) at the [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Xirong Li](http://lixirong.net).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree with honors in the Top-notch Program (a class of 15 elite students selected from 400+) from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn) in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Qijun Zhao](http://www.scubrl.org/qjzhao).
I've interned at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) and [KuaiShou](https://www.kuaishou.com/).

My research primarily revolves around **multi-media learning**, **video understanding**, **cross-modal retrieval**, and **open-set recognition**, complemented by a broad curiosity in generative model, RAG, RL, and LLM.
